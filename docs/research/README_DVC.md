# Digital Visual Computer (DVC) - Manifesto & Implementation Plan

## Vision
A machine-verifiable, human-auditable computation system where every execution becomes a permanent, attestable artifact ("Hall of Drift") with communal ritual ("Blessing Ritual").

## Core Components
### Virtual Machine
- Stack-based deterministic execution engine
- Full step-by-step trace with hash chaining for integrity verification
- Content-addressed memory operations

### Visual Ritual System
4-pane SVG viewer showing:
1. Palette/opcodes (color mappings)
2. Disassembly view
3. IR/dataflow visualization
4. Outputs/state snapshots

### Packaging Format (.dvcf)
Content-addressed ZIP-like bundle containing:
- Program source code
- Execution trace
- Visual artifacts
- Proof/attestation metadata

## Pixel-Program System
- Horizontal row of pixels where blue channel encodes symbols
- 255 = "evaluate now" marker
- Decoded using color mapping to operators (254:+, 253:-, etc.)
- Enables direct expression evaluation from visual input

## Ceremony Design
**Blessing Ritual Sequence:**
1. Opening (manifest + final hash)
2. Truth in the open (4-pane ritual)
3. Drift acknowledgment (side-by-side diffs)
4. Commitment (multi-sig sealing)
5. Closing (ledger entry + QR)

**Rehearsal Kit Includes:**
- Two sample .dvcf bundles (blank drift and populated run)
- Simple scripts for practice

## Roadmap Implementation Plan
| Phase | Focus Areas | Milestones |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **v0.1** | Core & Covenant | VM implementation, viewer, verifier, RFC schemas, blessing viewer |
| **v0.2–0.5** | Stability & Scale | Merkle memory, streaming verification, multi-sig blessings, drift analysis engine |
| **v1.0** | Ecosystem | IPFS integration, compute marketplace, standardized proofs directory |
| **v2.0+** | Living Chronicle | Temporal lineage queries, adversarial drift games, formal ritual language |

## Next Steps
1. Consolidate all research documents into single implementation guide
2. Create GitHub issue templates aligned to roadmap milestones
3. Implement minimal dvc_viewer_replayer.py with CSV test case
4. Develop sample .dvcf bundles for rehearsal and validation

> ℹ️ **Note**: All components are designed to work together through content-addressed identifiers and ritual-based verification protocols, ensuring traceability and communal trust in computational artifacts.
