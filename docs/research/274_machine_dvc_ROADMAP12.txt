PXOS DVC v0.1 Implementer's Guide1. Quick StartThis guide provides a hands-on walkthrough of the PXOS DVC v0.1 system. It is a companion to the RFC-PXOS-DVC-0.1: Visual-as-Proof Architecture and is designed to get you from a fresh clone to a working artifact in minutes.PrerequisitesPython 3.8+The dvc_v01 codebase (which includes dvc_vm.py, dvc_svg.py, dvc_pack.py, dvc_verify.py, etc.)SetupCreate a project directory and navigate into it.Place all DVC files into this directory.Run the end-to-end demo runner:python3 demo_e2e.py
This script automates the full lifecycle: building a bundle, packing it into a .dvcf container, verifying its integrity, and extracting its contents for inspection.Expected OutputA successful run will produce a log that looks like this:‚Üí python3 demo_build.py
Building bundle...
Writing out/demo_bundle.json
Writing out/demo_ritual.svg
Outputs: [36, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Final root: deadfacecafebeef00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff0011...
‚Üí python3 dvc_pack.py pack --bundle out/demo_bundle.json --svg out/demo_ritual.svg --out build/demo.dvcf --name DVC v0.1 demo
‚úì packed build/demo.dvcf
‚Üí python3 dvc3.verify.py build/demo.dvcf
‚úì Trace hash-chain OK (11 steps) ‚Äî final_root=deadfa...
‚úì Semantic re-execution OK ‚Äî final_root=deadfa...
‚úì build/demo.dvcf VERIFIED
‚Üí python3 dvc_pack.py extract build/demo.dvcf --to extracted
‚úì extracted to extracted

‚úÖ Demo complete.
    Bundle:     out/demo_bundle.json
    Ritual:     out/demo_ritual.svg
    DVCF:       build/demo.dvcf
    Extracted:  extracted
This output confirms that the entire pipeline, from program execution to cryptographic verification, is working as expected.2. Core Components2.1 The VM (dvc_vm.py)The VM is the core of the DVC. It is a deterministic stack machine that executes a list of (opcode, operand) tuples and generates a canonical trace.from dvc_vm import VM

# 1. Create a VM with a fixed memory size
vm = VM(memory_size=1024)

# 2. Define a program using the DVC v0.1 ISA
program = [
    ("PUSHI", 5),
    ("PUSHI", 7),
    ("ADD", None),
    ("OUT", None),
    ("HALT", None)
]

# 3. Load the program into the VM
vm.load_program(program)

# 4. Run the program and get the result
result = vm.run(inputs=[])

# The result object contains the final state and the full trace
print(f"Output: {result.outputs}")  # [12]
print(f"Final root: {result.final_root}")
2.2 The Ritual Renderer (dvc_svg.py)This tool takes a run bundle and produces a human-auditable SVG visualization, fulfilling the "human-first audit" principle.import json
from dvc_svg import render_ritual

# Load a run bundle from a file
with open("out/demo_bundle.json", "r") as f:
    bundle = json.load(f)

# Generate the 4-pane SVG ritual
svg_content = render_ritual(bundle)

# Save the SVG for viewing in a browser
with open("out/my_ritual.svg", "w") as f:
    f.write(svg_content)
2.3 The Verifier (dvc_verify.py)The verifier is the "truth engine." It performs a deep check to ensure that a computation's trace is valid and has not been tampered with.from pathlib import Path
from dvc_verify import verify_dvcf

# Verify a packaged .dvcf file
is_valid = verify_dvcf(Path("build/demo.dvcf"))
if is_valid:
    print("Verification passed! The computation is trustworthy.")
else:
    print("Verification failed! The computation may have drifted.")
2.4 The Packager (dvc_pack.py)The packager creates the official .dvcf artifact, which is a content-addressed container for the entire computation.import os
from dvc_pack import pack_dvcf

# Pack a bundle and its ritual into a .dvcf file
pack_dvcf(
    bundle_path="out/demo_bundle.json",
    svg_path="out/demo_ritual.svg",
    out_path="build/my_artifact.dvcf",
    name="My First DVC Artifact",
    shared_secret="yoursecret"
)
3. Writing Your First DVC Program3.1 A DVC Program in PythonA DVC program is a simple list of opcodes. This example computes 5! (factorial).# my_factorial.py
from dvc_vm import VM, result_to_bundle
import json

# The DVC program as a list of (opcode, argument) tuples
bytecode = [
    ("PUSHI", 1),       # acc = 1
    ("PUSHI", 5),       # counter = 5
    ("DUP", None),      # duplicate 5
    ("OUT", None),      # debug output: 5
    ("PUSHI", 1),       # PUSHI 1
    ("SWAP", None),     # swap
    ("SUB", None),      # counter--
    ("DUP", None),      # duplicate counter
    ("JZ", 11),         # if counter==0, JMP to HALT
    ("PUSH", 0),        # push acc from memory
    ("MUL", None),      # acc *= counter
    ("STORE", 0),       # store acc in memory
    ("JMP", 2),         # JMP to loop start
    ("LOAD", 0),        # load final result
    ("OUT", None),      # OUT
    ("HALT", None)      # HALT
]

# Run the program and generate the bundle
vm = VM(memory_size=1024)
vm.load_program(bytecode)
run_result = vm.run(inputs=[])
bundle = result_to_bundle(run_result, bytecode, {"title": "Factorial Program"})

# Save the bundle for packaging and ritual rendering
with open("out/factorial_bundle.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(bundle, f, indent=2)
3.2 Compiling from Visual IRThe ultimate goal is to generate bytecode from a visual representation (Visual-as-IR). Your dvc_pack.py tool can handle this seamlessly:# Program from a visual editor (e.g., as JSON)
visual_program = [
    {"op": "PUSHI", "arg": 5},
    {"op": "PUSHI", "arg": 7},
    {"op": "ADD"}
]

# A simple visual compiler would produce this bytecode
bytecode = [("PUSHI", 5), ("PUSHI", 7), ("ADD", None)]
4. Troubleshooting and Contributing4.1 Common Verification FailuresHash Mismatch: The most common error. This indicates a drift between the stored and re-computed state. This can be due to a bug in your VM, an inconsistent final_root, or a corrupted bundle.dvc_verify.py will tell you exactly which step and hash failed.4.2 Adding New OpcodesUpdate dvc_vm.py: Add a new method op_<OPCODE_NAME> to the VM class.Update dvc_vm.py's OPCODES map: Add the new opcode to the lookup table.Update the schemas: Add the new opcode to dvc_bundle.schema.json and dvc_manifest.schema.json.Update dvc_svg.py: Add a visual representation for the new opcode.5. Next StepsImplement Merkleized Memory: Upgrade dvc_vm.py to use a Merkle tree for memory state commitments, improving scalability and enabling partial proofs.Develop the Blessing Ritual Viewer: A browser-based viewer that animates the full ritual from a .dvcf file.Formalize Contribution: Set up a public repository on GitHub, define a test harness, and welcome community contributions.This guide provides everything needed to start working with PXOS DVC v0.1. It bridges the gap between the formal specification and a practical, hands-on development experience.



















Okay, based on the analysis and components delivered for the DVC v0.1 prototype, here is a strategic roadmap to mature the project:

**PXOS Digital Visual Computer - v0.1 Roadmap**

This roadmap outlines the steps to evolve the successful v0.1 prototype into a robust, standardized, and community-driven platform.

**Phase 1: Foundation & Formalization (v0.1.x - Specification & Core Stability)**

*   **Goal:** Solidify the v0.1 design into a formal, unambiguous specification and ensure its core implementation is reliable and verifiable.
*   **Milestones:**
    1.  **Publish Formal Specification (RFC):**
        *   Finalize and publish the "PXOS DVC v0.1 Living Roadmap" / RFC document.
        *   Include: Core VM model, ISA definition (opcodes, stack/memory effects), Trace schema (detailed fields, hash-chaining mechanism), `.dvcf` bundle format (`manifest.json`, `bundle.json`, `ritual.svg`), and cryptographic commitments (final_root derivation).
        *   Use normative language ("MUST", "SHOULD").
    2.  **Cross-Implementation Verification:**
        *   Implement a second, independent VM (e.g., in Rust or JavaScript).
        *   Establish a shared test suite with "golden" programs.
        *   Perform differential fuzzing and golden-path testing to ensure bit-for-bit identical `final_root` and traces across implementations, proving the spec's clarity and the implementations' determinism.
    3.  **Enhance Core Tooling:**
        *   Refine `dvc_verify.py` to be the definitive verification tool against the spec.
        *   Stabilize `dvc_pack.py` as the standard packager/unpackager for `.dvcf` files.
        *   Ensure `dvc_svg.py` strictly adheres to the spec for ritual rendering.

**Phase 2: Scalability & Advanced Features (v0.2 - Performance & Proofs)**

*   **Goal:** Address limitations in trace size and verification for larger programs, and introduce stronger attestation methods.
*   **Milestones:**
    1.  **Implement Merkleized Memory:**
        *   Modify the VM and trace schema to replace simple memory hashes (`mem_commit`) with Merkle roots (`mem_root`).
        *   Update the trace schema to include `mem_root_before` and `mem_root_after` for each step.
        *   Update the verifier to handle Merkle proofs for memory operations.
        *   This enables partial state verification and is foundational for ZK proofs.
    2.  **Introduce Stronger Attestation:**
        *   Integrate Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) attestation (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV) as an option for generating hardware-backed proofs of execution within the `.dvcf`.
        *   *(Future)* Begin exploration and integration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs - SNARKs/STARKs) for succinct verification of complex computations, leveraging the structured trace and Merkleized memory.

**Phase 3: Community & Ecosystem (v0.3 - Adoption & Expansion)**

*   **Goal:** Foster community adoption, improve developer onboarding, and expand the platform's capabilities and reach.
*   **Milestones:**
    1.  **Develop Implementer's Guide & Quickstart:**
        *   Create a companion document to the RFC that is example-driven and practical, guiding new contributors through building and using DVC components.
        *   Provide clear examples for integrating the VM, verifier, packager, and renderer.
    2.  **Establish the Hall of Drift & Public Portal:**
        *   Set up a public repository or website (the "Hall of Drift") for curating, displaying, and blessing `.dvcf` artifacts.
        *   Make the `blessing_ritual.html` viewer accessible via this portal.
    3.  **Prototype Visual-as-IR Editor (Exploratory):**
        *   Begin work on a visual interface (grid, blocks, nodes) for composing DVC programs, which would compile down to the v0.1/v0.2 bytecode. This aligns with the previously discussed "Visual-as-IR" concept for improved UX without compromising the core Verifiable Trace Architecture.
    4.  **Community Building:**
        *   Open source core components.
        *   Encourage external contributions, audits, and implementations.
        *   Showcase example applications and use cases (e.g., calculators, simple DSLs, rule engines).

This roadmap provides a clear path from the successful prototype to a mature, verifiable, and community-supported Digital Visual Computer platform, maintaining the core principle of "machine-first truth, human-first audit."
















# PXOS DVC v0.1 Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Technical Fixes (Priority: Critical)
**Timeline: 1-2 months**

### 1.1 Address JSON Serialization Vulnerability
- **Issue**: Non-deterministic JSON serialization breaks cryptographic signatures
- **Solution**: Migrate to canonical binary format (DAG-CBOR)
- **Tasks**:
  - Update `dvc_pack.py` to use CBOR serialization with canonical encoding
  - Modify `dvc_verify.py` to handle CBOR deserialization
  - Update JSON schemas to CBOR schemas
  - Implement backward compatibility for existing `.dvcf` files
- **Success Criteria**: Signature verification works consistently across platforms

### 1.2 Implement Merkleized Memory
- **Issue**: Full memory serialization doesn't scale beyond trivial programs
- **Solution**: Replace memory commits with Merkle tree roots
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement Merkle tree construction for memory state
  - Update VM to compute memory roots instead of full hashes
  - Modify verifier to handle Merkleized memory verification
  - Add partial memory verification capabilities
- **Success Criteria**: 10x reduction in trace storage for memory-intensive programs

### 1.3 Cross-Implementation Verification
- **Issue**: Single implementation limits confidence in specification
- **Solution**: Build second VM in different language
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement TypeScript/JavaScript VM following RFC specification
  - Create shared test suite for both implementations
  - Verify identical `final_root` outputs for test cases
  - Document any specification ambiguities discovered

3.  **Open Covenant**: The spec must be vendor-neutral, community-owned, and freely licensed.
4.  **Success Metrics**:
    -   **Adoption**: Number of independent VM implementations.
    -   **Throughput**: Time to verify a bundle of size *n*.
    -   **Richness**: Size and diversity of the Hall of Drift.
    -   **Ceremony**: Number of unique entities blessing artifacts.

This roadmap provides a clear path from a working prototype to a world-changing system for computational trust. The sequence is designed to build momentum: each release delivers tangible value while laying the groundwork for the next.
