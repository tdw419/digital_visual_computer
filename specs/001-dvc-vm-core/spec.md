# Feature Specification: DVC Deterministic VM Core

**Feature Branch**: `[001-dvc-vm-core]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a Digital Visual Computer VM that executes programs deterministically with complete audit trails. Users need to run programs where every execution step is recorded, hashed, and chained together to create tamper-evident execution traces. The VM must be stack-based, support basic arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV), stack operations (PUSH, POP), and produce identical results for identical inputs across different machines and times. Each execution trace becomes a permanent artifact that can be independently verified by others."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   + If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   + Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   + Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   + If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   + Each requirement must be testable
   + Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   + If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   + If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- Mandatory sections: Must be completed for every feature
- Optional sections: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. Mark all ambiguities: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. Don't guess: If the prompt doesn't specify something, mark it
3. Think like a tester: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. Common underspecified areas:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a practitioner of the Digital Visual Computer, I want to execute a small program deterministically and receive a complete, tamper-evident execution trace so that anyone can independently verify the run and reproduce identical results later.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a valid program that computes 2 + 3 and prints the result, When I run the VM, Then the output is 5, the trace contains each step with pre/post stack snapshots, and the final hash matches the hash recomputed from the trace.
2. Given the same program, When I run it on another machine with the same inputs, Then the output, trace contents, and final hash are identical.
3. Given a program containing an unknown opcode, When I run the VM, Then execution halts with a fault recorded in the trace and a non-success status is indicated.
4. Given a program that divides by zero, When executed, Then the trace records the error at the step, the VM stops safely, and the final state reflects the error condition.

### Edge Cases
- Empty program (no opcodes): executes zero steps, produces empty output and a defined "empty" trace/root.
- Deep stack usage: push/pop operations beyond typical depth must remain deterministic.
- Large immediate values: pushing and operating on large integers behaves consistently.
- Maximum step limit: long-running or looping programs must respect a configurable step bound to avoid non-termination.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST execute a stack-based instruction set including arithmetic (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV) and stack ops (PUSH, POP).
- **FR-002**: System MUST produce a step-by-step execution trace capturing: instruction pointer, opcode, operands (if any), stack_before, stack_after, and any output emitted at the step.
- **FR-003**: System MUST compute a hash-chain over the execution steps that results in a final root/commitment for the run.
- **FR-004**: System MUST be deterministic: identical program + inputs produce identical outputs, trace, and final commitment.
- **FR-005**: System MUST record faults (e.g., unknown opcode, stack underflow, division by zero) as structured trace entries and halt safely.
- **FR-006**: System MUST expose a simple command interface to run a program and emit the trace as machine-readable output (text/JSON) suitable for verification.
- **FR-007**: System MUST support integer arithmetic with well-defined semantics (e.g., integer division truncation) and document them.
- **FR-008**: System MUST include a stable mapping from human-readable opcodes to encoded program words to avoid ambiguity.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow a maximum-steps or gas-like limit to guarantee termination when requested.
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a clear run status (success, halted, faulted) and summary (outputs, steps, final hash) at completion.

*Clarifications to obtain:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST define the integer size and overflow behavior [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: arbitrary-precision vs fixed-width and wrap/saturate rules].
- **FR-012**: System MUST specify endianness and encoding for immediate values in the program format [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
- **FR-013**: System SHOULD define a minimal canonical program container for v0.1 (raw words vs simple JSON) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **Program**: Ordered sequence of instruction words and immediates (source of execution).
- **Opcode**: Symbol/name and semantics (e.g., PUSHI, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, PRINT/HALT if included in core).
- **TraceStep**: { index, ip, opcode, operand?, stack_before, stack_after, outputs_so_far?, note?, fault? }.
- **Trace**: Ordered list of TraceStep plus metadata (start time, end time, step_count, final_hash).
- **HashChain**: Function to derive per-step commitment and final root from prior state and current step.
- **RunSummary**: { status, outputs, steps, final_hash } presented to users upon completion.
