# Feature Specification: Color Language v0.1 - Palette-Driven Visual Programming

**Feature Branch**: `003-color-language-v0`  
**Created**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Color language v0.1: palette-driven visual programming with PNG compilation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AI researcher or visual programmer, I need to write programs using colors instead of text, where each color represents a specific operation or data value. When I create a colorful grid image, the system should compile it into executable code that runs deterministically on the DVC VM, producing verifiable execution traces just like text-based programs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a PNG image with colored tiles and a palette.json mapping colors to opcodes, **When** I run `dvc color-compile`, **Then** I get a valid DVC JSON program that represents the visual instructions
2. **Given** a simple color program (red=PUSH 2, blue=PUSH 3, green=ADD, yellow=PRINT), **When** I run `dvc color-run`, **Then** I get the same execution trace and result as the equivalent JSON program  
3. **Given** two identical color programs run on different machines, **When** both use the same palette and deterministic settings, **Then** both produce byte-identical execution traces

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a pixel color doesn't match any palette entry?
- How does the system handle corrupted or invalid PNG files?
- What occurs if the palette.json file is missing or malformed?
- How are edge pixels or partial tiles handled in the grid?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST compile PNG images with colored tiles into valid DVC JSON programs using palette mappings
- **FR-002**: System MUST support exact RGB color matching with configurable tolerance thresholds
- **FR-003**: System MUST process images in deterministic tile order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom scanning)
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate palette.json files contain required color-to-opcode mappings
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle immediate values encoded as RGB color components for PUSH operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST reject programs with unrecognized colors or invalid tile boundaries
- **FR-007**: System MUST produce identical compilation output for identical PNG+palette combinations
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate compiled programs seamlessly with existing DVC VM execution
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve original PNG and palette files in trace bundles for audit purposes
- **FR-010**: System MUST support tile-based grid geometry. The tile size is configurable via the `tile_size` field in the palette.json. Default is 16x16 pixels.
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle PNG files with transparency. Alpha channels are currently ignored during color processing (converted to RGB).
- **FR-012**: System MUST define fiducial colors for alignment and versioning. Fiducial colors are reserved in the palette but not yet processed by the compiler/decoder.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ColorPalette**: Mapping between RGB colors and VM opcodes, including encoding rules for immediate values
- **ColorProgram**: PNG image containing colored tiles that represent executable instructions in grid layout
- **TileGrid**: Structured representation of image divided into fixed-size tiles with position information
- **ColorIR**: Intermediate representation containing decoded tiles with opcodes, positions, and arguments
- **CompileSummary**: Metadata about compilation including tile counts, decode settings, and palette hash
