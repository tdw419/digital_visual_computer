# DVC v0.1 Core Implementation Tasks

**Setup tasks**
- [ ] Create minimal project structure
- [ ] Configure test framework (pytest)
- [ ] Set up version control with Git hooks

**Tests-first tasks**
- [ ] Implement unit tests for VM execution flow (`test_vm.py`)
- [ ] Verify hash chaining integrity in trace validation
- [ ] Create contract verification tests for `dvc run` and `dvc verify`

**Core implementation tasks**
- [ ] Build stack-based VM with step-by-step tracing capability
- [ ] Implement opcode-to-color mapping system using canonical JSON format
- [ ] Develop basic `.dvcf` packaging format with manifest and hash chain
- [ ] Create CSV parser that validates pixel program syntax according to Phase 0-1 specifications

**Integration tasks**
- [ ] Connect VM to SVG viewer for 4-pane ritual display (palette/opcodes, disassembly)
- [ ] Integrate hash validation into verification pipeline using SHA-256 canonicalization
- [ ] Implement streaming verification mode that accepts partial trace inputs

**Polish tasks**
- [ ] Add performance metrics for execution traces with step timing
- [ ] Document all API contracts with concrete examples (program â†’ verify flow)
- [ ] Create minimal end-to-end test case using CSV input and expected output

**Verification checks**
- [ ] Ensure all implementation changes pass existing tests
- [ ] Confirm deterministic behavior across all test cases with integer arithmetic constraints
- [ ] Validate hash matches between inputs and outputs using SHA-256 canonicalization rules
