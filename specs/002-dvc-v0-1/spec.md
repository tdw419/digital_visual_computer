**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "DVC v0.1 core: deterministic VM with hash-chained execution traces"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a software developer or auditor, I need to run programs where every execution step is recorded, hashed, and chained together to create tamper-evident execution traces. When I run the same program with identical inputs, I must get identical execution traces regardless of when or where I run it, enabling independent verification and creating permanent computational artifacts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a simple program (e.g., "2 + 3"), **When** I execute it on the DVC VM, **Then** I get a complete trace showing each stack operation with hash-chained steps and final result "5"
2. **Given** the same program and trace from scenario 1, **When** another person runs verification on a different machine, **Then** they get identical step-by-step hashes confirming computational integrity
3. **Given** a program that performs multiple operations, **When** I execute it twice with identical inputs, **Then** both execution traces are byte-for-byte identical including all intermediate hashes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the program has infinite loops or exceeds execution limits?
- How does system handle invalid opcodes or malformed programs?
- What occurs if hash verification fails during trace replay?
- How are stack underflows or overflows managed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST execute programs deterministically producing identical results for identical inputs
- **FR-002**: System MUST record every execution step in a structured trace format
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate cryptographic hashes for each execution step and chain them together
- **FR-004**: System MUST support basic stack operations (PUSH, POP) and arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV)
- **FR-005**: System MUST halt execution and record final state when program completes or encounters HALT instruction
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect and handle stack underflow/overflow conditions gracefully
- **FR-007**: System MUST support trace verification through semantic replay of recorded steps
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide execution step limits to prevent infinite loops [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: default step limit value?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST encode programs in a standardized format [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: CSV format as specified in docs, or other format?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST produce machine-readable execution traces in structured format [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: JSON, binary, or other serialization?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Program**: Input sequence of instructions/operations to be executed
- **Opcode**: Individual instruction type (NOP, HALT, PUSH, POP, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, PRINT)
- **TraceStep**: Single execution step containing instruction pointer, opcode, stack state, and step hash
- **ExecutionTrace**: Complete sequence of TraceSteps with hash chain linking each step
- **VMState**: Current machine state including stack contents, instruction pointer, and execution status
- **HashChain**: Cryptographic linkage between execution steps ensuring tamper evidence
